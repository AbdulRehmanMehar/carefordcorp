# CarefordCorp - eCommerce Application


## How to RUN?

Before you may run the app, you must have python v3 installed along with pip.
Clone this repository and run `python -m venv venv` to make virtual environment.
Now it is the time to install dependencies, `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Rename app-demo.config to app.config and put your variables/data.

Everything feels good! Type `python app.py` to launch the application.
